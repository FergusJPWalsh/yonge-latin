PREFACE
The present Work does not profess to be a complete Thesaurus of the Latin language, but only a School Dictionary. It, therefore, does not aim at giving every imaginable Latin word for the corresponding English one, but only a few of the best.
In its compilation, I have followed the plan which I adopted in my English-Greek Lexicon, so that I have given scarcely any words which are not sanctioned by the use of the writers of the present age, beginning wigh Cicero and ending with Ovid. For all other words I have added the authority, even when they are employed by such standard writers as Tacitus, Pliny, or Quintilian.
I have, as will be seen, had recourse, in a very great degree, to phrases, which are always given in the exact language of the author cited; and in the selection of which I have confined myself entirely to Cicero, the writers of the Augustan age, and the three others above-mentioned. All the letters from different writers in the Collection of Cicero’s Epistles I quote as Cic., to avoid confusion, as it is evident that, for the purpose of which the phrase is cited here, the authority of Cicero’s contemporaries is equal to his own.
I have given the construction of verbs and adjectives, when at all irregular, or variable; and the declension, genitive case, and gender of nouns, whenever the termination of the nominative case left them doubtful.
I have marked the quantaties of all doubtful syllables, and distinguished words used only by poets by an asterisk.
